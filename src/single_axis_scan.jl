"""
This function initializes connections with the xyz stage and the
Oscilloscope. The program does this by calling ky_xyz_init and
ky_scope_rs_init. This function takes 6 input arguements and 4 of those
are mandatory. If there is no previous structure settings from previous
initializations (if this is the first time the user calls this function),
leave settings blank. Also, the default stage will be 'new' if not
entered. This stage is the newer stage located in the larger lab room.

Input:
       xyz: The handle of desired xyz stage
     scope: Handle of desired scope
   channel: This input decides which channel the scope will read from.
sample_size: The amount of samples desired to be taken.


Ex.
```
lts = initialize(ThorlabsLTS150)
scope = initialize(Scope350MHz)
# Sample size 100, read from scope on channel 1
hydrophone = Hydrophone(lts, scope, 100, 1)
```

 This function moves along the x axis and grabs data based on a fixed
 increment passed by the user. This program uses the ky_scope_rs_ch_data
 function that returns a structure with helpful information. There are
 three mantadory inputs and one optional input that is used only when this
 function is called by other functions and the printed messages should be
 supressed. The user usually doesn't have to use the variable called.

 Delete:
       settings: the structure for all controller connections.
 Input: 
     hydrophone: the structure for all controller connections.
        axis_range: A 1x2 or 1x1 array that contains the start and end point
                 of the desired range in the x-direction.
          num_points: The number of points the user desires to record along the
                 x-axis.
         called: This variable is either one or zero and is used to turn
                 off user notifications when another function calls this
                 one. User usually won't have to use this variable.

 Output:
   wave_info_x: A structure that contains the data that traces num_points of
                waveforms and the coordinates travelled. The waveforms are
                stored under wave_info_x.wave_form and the coordinates 
                travelled is stored under wave_info_x.coordinates. The
                coordinates are the (x, y, z) coordinates along the path
                that the function took.

 scan_range = [0 1]; num_points = 5;
 wave_info_x = ky_hydro_scan_x(settings, scan_range, num_points);
